To be valid, your program should have only the variables and the sum expression in it. Any other statement such as function or variable declaration or any other type of statement, comment, or even a comment in the variable is invalid.
You are given a string which contains the name of a function. Your task is to create a function with this name which takes 2 integers as arguments and returns the sum of them. The function should have only one line of return statement.
The function name is given as a string argument to the main function. The function should also be created dynamically. You may not create any other function or any other variable.
The name of the function is given as a string argument to the main function.
