large (target) model autoregressive_sampling: Develop a Python script for a basic e-commerce shopping cart. This script allows a customer to see all available products, add items to their cart, modify the quantity of items in their cart, and then checkout and pay for items in their cart. It allows an administrator to add, delete, or edit the available products. The script uses persistent data using the built-in shelve module.
The customer should be able to view the available products by calling a command line argument of show_products. This will show all the items, their id, name, price, and quantity.
Additionally, the customer should be able to call the checkout command line argument. This will prompt the customer to enter a quantity for each item they want to purchase. This should also prompt the customer if they want to purchase any other items or continue checking out. If they select to continue checking out, it should prompt them for another quantity for another item. If they choose not to purchase another item, it should ask if they would like to purchase any of the items in

You should be able to create a basic shopping cart.
The cart should be able to take in user input for products and then output the total cost of the purchase.

You can use this code as the base of your shopping cart:

import sys

print("Welcome to the Shopping Cart program.")

item = input("What would you like to purchase: ")
quantity = input("How many: ")

# Output for the user
print("You chose: " + item)
print("The quantity is: " + quantity)

print("Your total is: $" + str(int(quantity)*10))

# End program
sys.exit()

# Create a shopping cart.
# A user should be able to enter an item and quantity.
# It should output the total.
# Your shopping cart should be able to keep track of the items and quantities.
